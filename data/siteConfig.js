  authorDescription: `My interest in technology started at an early age, being a lifelong self-starter, I enjoy doing front end web development and have been using JavaScript, CSS and ReactJs to construct well tested user interfaces using constantly evolving techniques to solve UX/UI problems. I have worked in agile teams with 100% of my contributions to projects being delivered on time and on budget. I equally enjoy growing and sharing my knowledge in solving interesting problems related to responsive layouts and accessibility.
