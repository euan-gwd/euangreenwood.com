  authorDescription: `I am self-taught, my interest in technology started at an early age, professionally I started as a Microsoft systems and network administrator for a small manufacturing firm. I then moved on to do both <strong>web design</strong> with Flash and Action Script and 3D animation and visual effects using 3D Studio Max.  Before moving back to do <strong>technical support</strong> in the Apple industry, starting with an Apple retailer and service center doing both hardware repairs and software support and finally moving on to do corporate support.  Recently moved back into <strong>web app development</strong>. Where I enjoy constructing user interfaces using <strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong> and <strong>ReactJs</strong> to solve interesting problems.
